## 🌧️ Problem Statement
During the monsoon, we often rush to bring clothes inside to protect them from unexpected rain. This project solves that real-world problem automatically.

## 🛠️ Project Overview
The Smart Rain Detector system automatically brings your clothes under shelter when it starts raining, and moves them back outside once the weather is clear for drying.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino (any compatible board)
- Rain Sensor
- Motor Driver (L298N or similar)
- DC Motor
- Wires and connectors
- Supporting structure for cloth movement

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Rain Detected:** Rain sensor detects rainfall → Motor rotates in **first direction** for a few seconds to pull clothes **under the roof**.
2. **Rain Stops:** When the sensor detects **no rain**, motor rotates in the **opposite direction**, returning the clothes **outside for drying**.

## 🔄 Automation Goal
This system automates cloth collection and re-drying, saving time and protecting clothes during uncertain monsoon weather.

## 📦 Status
✅ Working prototype tested in real conditions.
